November 10 2005

On November 2005 Glulxa's license has changed to GPL, as Glulxa
had previously no specific license. This has been done under the 
consentiment of the original copyright holder: Simon Stapleton.

No information has been changed in documentation, so if you find some
disagreement between readme file contents and the license agreement
included at COPYING file please forget about what readme file says, 
just take care of COPYING file.

These are e-mails regarding the license change (Simon also gave 
premission to make them public), I'm not including Carlos' e-mails 
as Simon quoted properly them in his answers:

Yep, you got the right guy

As I recall, I released it either public domain or BSD licensed.  The
actual licensing terms migt be found by searching the raif archives,
but in case they are gone forever : Feel free to do what the hell you
like with it, including GPLing it or whatever you like.  I'm glad to
see that something I wrote as a laugh is actually of some marginal
use to somebody.  It also gives me a warm fuzzy feeling that people
do actually care about doing the right things WRT licensing.  You get
a big smile for that.

Sure, that too.

 Yeah, go for it.  I suspect pretty much every link to it is dead  these
 days.  Take the code, treat it as your own, license it how you  like.
